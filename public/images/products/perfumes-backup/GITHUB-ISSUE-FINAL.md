# üö® Critical: Stripe API Connection Failures on Vercel Functions

## Bug Report Summary

**Issue:** Vercel Functions consistently fail to connect to Stripe API, causing 100% payment processing failures in production.

**Impact:** This blocks ALL e-commerce sites using Next.js on Vercel from processing payments, making it a critical infrastructure issue.

---

## üîç Bug Description

When deploying Next.js applications with Stripe integration to Vercel, all Stripe API calls fail with connection errors:

```
An error occurred with our connection to Stripe. Request was retried 3 times.
```

**Key Details:**
- ‚úÖ **Local Development:** Works perfectly with identical code and API keys
- ‚ùå **Vercel Production:** 100% failure rate across all Stripe API calls
- üéØ **Reproducible:** Consistent across multiple projects and accounts
- üö® **Business Critical:** Prevents payment processing entirely

## üß™ Reproduction Case

I've created a minimal reproduction repository that demonstrates this issue:

**üì¶ Repository:** https://github.com/0xjc65eth/vercel-stripe-reproduction

### Quick Steps to Reproduce:

1. **Clone the reproduction repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0xjc65eth/vercel-stripe-reproduction.git
   cd vercel-stripe-reproduction
   npm install
   ```

2. **Add your Stripe key in Vercel dashboard:**
   ```
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_actual_key
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   npx vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Test the API endpoint:**
   ```
   Visit: https://your-deployment.vercel.app/api/test-stripe
   ```

5. **Observe the failure:**
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "error": "Stripe connection failed",
     "message": "An error occurred with our connection to Stripe..."
   }
   ```

### Local Testing (Works):
```bash
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_actual_key
npm run dev
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/api/test-stripe
# ‚úÖ Returns successful connection
```

## üíª Environment Details

- **Next.js:** 15.5.3 (App Router)
- **Stripe SDK:** 14.25.0 (latest)
- **Node.js:** 18.x/20.x (Vercel default)
- **Runtime:** Vercel Functions
- **API Keys:** Both `sk_test_` and `sk_live_` fail identically

---

## üîß What We've Tested

**‚úÖ Configurations Tested (all fail on Vercel):**
- Multiple Stripe SDK timeout settings (5s, 10s, 30s)
- Different retry strategies (0, 1, 3, 5 retries)
- Various API versions (2023-10-16, 2024-06-20)
- Direct HTTPS calls to api.stripe.com (bypassing SDK)
- Both live and test API keys
- Different Stripe SDK versions (13.x, 14.x)
- Manual DNS resolution attempts

**‚ùå All Result in Same Error:**
```
Connection to Stripe failed: An error occurred with our connection to Stripe. Request was retried X times.
```

## üìä Expected vs Actual Behavior

| Environment | Expected Result | Actual Result |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Local Development** | ‚úÖ Stripe API Success | ‚úÖ Stripe API Success |
| **Vercel Production** | ‚úÖ Stripe API Success | ‚ùå Connection Timeout/Failure |

## üö® Business Impact

This issue affects **all e-commerce sites** using:
- Next.js App Router + Vercel + Stripe
- Payment processing workflows
- Subscription management
- Webhook handling

**Result:** Complete inability to process payments in production, forcing developers to migrate away from Vercel or implement complex workarounds.

---

## üîç Technical Analysis

The issue appears to be related to:

1. **Network connectivity** between Vercel Functions and api.stripe.com
2. **DNS resolution** issues in Vercel's infrastructure
3. **Firewall/proxy** configurations blocking Stripe API calls
4. **Function environment** differences affecting network stack

The fact that identical code works locally but fails consistently on Vercel suggests an infrastructure-level networking issue.

---

## üí° Potential Root Causes

1. **Vercel Function Network Restrictions:** Possible firewall rules blocking Stripe endpoints
2. **DNS Resolution Issues:** Vercel Functions may have DNS configuration problems
3. **SSL/TLS Handshake Failures:** Certificate validation issues with api.stripe.com
4. **Geographic Routing:** Vercel edge functions may route through regions blocked by Stripe
5. **Function Timeout Conflicts:** Vercel's timeout handling interfering with Stripe's retry logic

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Temporary Workarounds

Currently testing:
- Custom retry logic with exponential backoff
- Alternative Stripe SDK configurations
- Direct HTTP calls bypassing the official SDK
- Webhook-based payment flows to avoid API calls

However, none provide a reliable production solution.
