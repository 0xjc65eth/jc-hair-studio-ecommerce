## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js v18+** installed
- **Git** access to the repository
- **Internet connection** for API testing
- **Environment variables** configured

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Should output: v18.x.x or higher
```

---

## 🛠️ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Clone and Install

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd jc-hair-studio

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Verify test files exist
ls tests/
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment

```bash
# Set the base URL for testing
export TEST_BASE_URL="https://jc-hair-studio-iqxbgl0d5-0xjc65eths-projects.vercel.app"

# Or create a .env.test file
echo "TEST_BASE_URL=https://jc-hair-studio-iqxbgl0d5-0xjc65eths-projects.vercel.app" > .env.test
```

### Step 3: Verify Setup

```bash
# Test basic connectivity
curl $TEST_BASE_URL/api/health

# Should return: {"status":"ok"} or similar
```

## 📈 Interpreting Results

### Success Indicators

- ✅ **GREEN CHECKMARKS** = Tests passed
- 📊 **Grade A-F** = Overall system assessment
- 🎯 **Success Rate %** = Percentage of passed tests
- ⏱️ **Duration** = Total test execution time

### Common Grades

- **A+ (95-100%)** = Production ready, excellent performance
- **A (90-94%)** = Production ready with minor optimizations
- **B (80-89%)** = Good performance, some improvements needed
- **C (70-79%)** = Acceptable, multiple improvements required
- **F (<70%)** = Critical issues, not production ready

### Performance Metrics

- **Response Time** = How fast the system responds
- **Throughput** = Requests processed per second
- **Error Rate** = Percentage of failed requests
- **Uptime** = System availability percentage

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### ❌ "Connection refused" error
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if the application is running
curl $TEST_BASE_URL/api/health

# Verify environment variable
echo $TEST_BASE_URL
```

#### ❌ "Email service failed" error
**Solution:**
- Check SendGrid API key in environment variables
- Verify admin email configuration
- Ensure internet connectivity

#### ❌ "Tests timing out" error
**Solution:**
```bash
# Increase timeout
TIMEOUT=60000 node tests/[test-file].mjs

# Check system resources
# Ensure the server isn't overloaded
```

#### ❌ "Rate limit exceeded" error
**Solution:**
- Wait a few minutes between test runs
- Run tests with longer delays
- Check API rate limits

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable verbose logging
DEBUG=true VERBOSE=true node tests/notifications/advanced-notification-test.mjs
```
