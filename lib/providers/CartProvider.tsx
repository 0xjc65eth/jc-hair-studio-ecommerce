/**
 * Usage Instructions:
 *
 * Wrap your application root with CartInitializer:
 *
 * <CartInitializer>
 *   <YourAppComponents />
 * </CartInitializer>
 *
 * This ensures:
 * 1. Cart loads from localStorage before any page renders
 * 2. Prevents "Carrinho Vazio" in checkout when items exist
 * 3. Provides consistent cart state across all components
 * 4. Eliminates race conditions between cart initialization and page rendering
