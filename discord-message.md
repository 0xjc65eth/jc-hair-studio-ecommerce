**🚨 URGENT: Production Payment System Down - Stripe Connection Failure**

Hey team, need urgent help! Our production payment system is completely down due to connection failures between Vercel Functions and Stripe Live API.

**Project:** jc-hair-studio
**Domain:** https://jchairstudios62.xyz
**Error:** `An error occurred with our connection to Stripe. Request was retried X times.`

**What we've tried:**
- ✅ Verified Live API keys are correct
- ✅ Tested multiple SDK configurations
- ✅ Implemented retry logic and fallbacks
- ✅ Created minimal test endpoints
- ❌ All attempts fail with same connection error

**Impact:**
- 🔴 100% payment failure rate
- 🔴 Business critical - no transactions possible
- 🔴 Customers unable to complete purchases

**Code works perfectly:**
- ✅ Locally with same keys
- ✅ In other environments

Seems like infrastructure-level issue between Vercel and Stripe. Any known issues or required configurations?

**Test endpoints created:**
- `/api/payment-direct`
- `/api/checkout-direct`
- `/api/payment-minimal`
- `/api/diagnose-stripe`

Can someone from Vercel team please investigate? Happy to provide more details or debugging info.

Thanks! 🙏
